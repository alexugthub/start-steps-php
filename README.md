A simple start to a powerful journey: the note-taking web app with big ambitions

## Introduction

Steps is a streamlined, single-file PHP application designed to evolve with your
needs. Beginning as a straightforward note-taking tool, it will gradually evolve
into a comprehensive system for managing initiatives, decisions, roadmaps, goals
and more. It aims to be a versatile platform that grows with the user and adapts
to their requirements. Give it a try and share feedback, suggestions, or issues.

## Installation

Steps is designed to be easy to install and run. It requires only PHP and SQLite
(for now) to function, making it lightweight and accessible. Users can run it on
any web server that supports PHP, such as Apache or Nginx. The whole application
is packaged as a single file, for easy deployment. Just download the `index.php`
file and place it in your web server's document root (*public_html*). You access
the application by navigating to `http://your-server/steps.php` in your browser.
